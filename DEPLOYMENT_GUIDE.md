# Deployment Guide - Attack on Titan To-Do List

This guide will walk you through deploying your application with:
- **Backend**: Render (with PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Netlify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Render

---

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account with your code pushed to a repository
2. A Render account (sign up at https://render.com)
3. A Netlify account (sign up at https://netlify.com)

---

## Part 1: Deploy Backend on Render

### Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Database

1. Log into your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Configure your database:
   - **Name**: `attack-on-titan-db`
   - **Database**: `attack_on_titan`
   - **User**: (auto-generated)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to you (e.g., Oregon)
   - **Plan**: Free
4. Click **"Create Database"**
5. **Important**: Save the **Internal Database URL** (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Deploy Backend Web Service

1. In Render Dashboard, click **"New +"** â†’ **"Web Service"**
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `attack-on-titan-backend`
   - **Region**: Same as database (e.g., Oregon)
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: `server`
   - **Runtime**: Python 3
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
   - **Plan**: Free

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   Click "Advanced" â†’ "Add Environment Variable" and add these:

   ```
   FLASK_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=[Use the Internal Database URL from Step 1]
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=[Generate using: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"]
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app (we'll update this after deploying frontend)
   ```

5. Click **"Create Web Service"**
6. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
7. **Save your backend URL**: `https://attack-on-titan-backend.onrender.com`

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations

After your backend is deployed:

1. Go to your web service in Render
2. Click on the **"Shell"** tab
3. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd server
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Part 2: Deploy Frontend on Netlify

### Step 1: Build Configuration

Your repository already has `netlify.toml` configured. Make sure it's in the `client` folder.

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. Log into [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click **"Add new site"** â†’ **"Import an existing project"**
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `client`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `client/dist`
   - **Branch**: `main`

5. **Add Environment Variables**:
   Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables** and add:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://attack-on-titan-backend.onrender.com/api
   VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=https://attack-on-titan-backend.onrender.com
   ```

6. Click **"Deploy site"**
7. Wait for deployment (2-5 minutes)
8. **Save your frontend URL**: e.g., `https://attack-on-titan-todo.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS

1. Go back to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your backend web service
3. Go to **"Environment"** tab
4. Update the `FRONTEND_URL` variable with your Netlify URL:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://attack-on-titan-todo.netlify.app
   ```
5. Save and wait for automatic redeployment

---

## Part 3: Verification

### Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Try to sign up for a new account
3. Create a task
4. Test real-time updates (open in two browser tabs)
5. Check that all features work:
   - Authentication (login/signup)
   - Task CRUD operations
   - Canvas view
   - Calendar view
   - Theme customization

---

## Environment Variables Summary

### Backend (Render)
```env
FLASK_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<provided-by-render>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app
```

### Frontend (Netlify)
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

---

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Symptom**: Browser console shows CORS policy errors

**Solution**:
1. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Render matches your Netlify URL exactly
2. Make sure both URLs use `https://` (no trailing slash)
3. Redeploy backend after changing environment variables

### Issue: WebSocket Connection Failed

**Symptom**: Real-time updates don't work

**Solution**:
1. Check `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL` in Netlify environment variables
2. Render's free tier may have cold starts - first connection may take 30-60 seconds
3. WebSocket should fall back to polling automatically

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Symptom**: Backend crashes or shows database errors

**Solution**:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` in Render environment variables
2. Check that database migrations have run: `flask db upgrade`
3. Ensure PostgreSQL instance is running

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Symptom**: Can't login or stay logged in

**Solution**:
1. Verify `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is set in Render
2. Check that `JWT_COOKIE_SECURE` is True in production (app.py)
3. Ensure both frontend and backend use `https://`

### Issue: Build Fails on Netlify

**Symptom**: Netlify build fails during npm install or build

**Solution**:
1. Check `package.json` for correct dependencies
2. Verify `netlify.toml` has correct paths
3. Check build logs for specific error messages
4. Try deploying from a clean branch

## Updating Your Deployment

### To Update Backend:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. Monitor deployment in Render dashboard

### To Update Frontend:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Netlify will automatically redeploy
3. Monitor deployment in Netlify dashboard

### To Update Database Schema:
1. Create new migration locally: `flask db migrate -m "description"`
2. Push migration file to GitHub
3. After backend deploys, run in Render Shell: `flask db upgrade`

---

## Cost Estimates

### Free Tier Limits:
- **Render PostgreSQL**: 1 free database, 90 days (then paid)
- **Render Web Service**: Free (sleeps after 15 min inactivity)
- **Netlify**: 100 GB bandwidth/month, 300 build minutes/month

### Notes:
- Render free tier services "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep may take 30-60 seconds
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for production apps with real users

## Security Checklist

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is a strong, randomly generated secret
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` is kept secret (never in git)
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` in backend matches your Netlify domain exactly
- [ ] All sensitive credentials are in environment variables, not code
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (not committed to git)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic on both Render and Netlify)
- [ ] CORS is configured to only allow your frontend domain

---

## Next Steps

1. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - Add custom domain in Netlify
   - Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Render accordingly

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up Render notification webhooks
   - Enable Netlify deployment notifications

3. **Backups**:
   - Render provides automatic PostgreSQL backups
   - Consider periodic manual backups for critical data

4. **Performance**:
   - Monitor response times in Render logs
   - Check Netlify analytics for frontend performance

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Render logs (Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Logs)
2. Check Netlify deploy logs (Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Deploys â†’ Deploy log)
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly

**Congratulations! Your Attack on Titan To-Do List is now deployed! ðŸŽ‰**
